### Project Description:

Rabbit population can be studied using the logistic map equation which models population growth or decline over several generations.

The logistic map equation was used to observe the different growth rates and the effect different rates have on future iterations.

The logistic map's bifurcation diagram was recreated in order to further investigate the periods of stability within the logistic map equation. It was noted that when the growth rate value, r, reaches 3, the population oscillates between multiple values and does not stabilize at a certain value.

To produce the bifurcation diagram, rate=1 and rate=2 figures:

~ python logistic_map.py

Ensure you have python 3.6 and the necessary dependencies.

Furthermore, the Lokta-Volterra equation were used to describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two species interact. To verify this model, population of snowshoe hares and lynx was used to see the relationship between the predator and prey. Data
was obtained from the Hudson Bay Compan's archives in which they estimated Snow Shoe Hare and Lynx populations based on the 
number of pelts sold each year.

To produce the Predator Prey Relations figure:

~ python HudsonBayPlot.py

Ensure you have python 3.6 and the necessary dependencies.

Results from the experiment prove the similarities between the logistic map and Lokta-Volterra equations, particularly their cyclic nature.
